       <p>Now a days, there is always a "trending food." Here is where I want to feature the foods that I feel are currently trendning foods.</p>

            <h3>Cauliflower</h3>
            <p>Cauliflower is not just a simple boring vegetable. It all started as a gluten-free, low carb alternative to wheat flour and pizza crust and blew up. Cauliflower is now used for everything. It is a great healthy alternative.  </p>

            <p>
                Using a Cuisinart puree frozen garlic cauliflower, a small chicken broth and seasoning.

            <h3>Chickpeas</h3>
            <p>Chickpeas are a great stable whether it is as a snack, in a salad, or as hummus. I LOVE chickpeas. I feel like there is so much you can do with them. </p>

            <h4>Snack Idea!</h4>
            <h5>Crispy Chickpeas</h5>
            <p>
                Lay chickpeas out on a pan with any of your favorite seasonings (I use truffle salt) 
                Pre heat to 400 degrees 
                Continuously check on them and mix them around until theyâ€™re crispy

            <h3>Spring Rolls</h3>
            <p>No, I am not talking about the fried spring rolls you get at a Chinese restaurant. I am talking about the healthy yummy and fresh spring rolls that can be made at home or found at certain restaurants. The ones wrapped in rice paper with crab or shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber, and carrots and of course sauce of your choice (I choose duck sauce). This is one of my personal favorite and healthy snacks.</p>
