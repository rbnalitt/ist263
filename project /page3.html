                Hidden gem. Very small and intimate vibe but very pretty. It’s a fancier restaurant a place for a date or with your parents. High quality food but definitely not meant for picky eaters. Great wine. Does not feel like you are in Syracuse. Menu changes weekly and is small.

                One of my all-time favorite sushi restaurants. AMAZING. Small and intimate vibe. Not a fun restaurant but definitely for foodies. Have basic sushi but also crazy sushi. So many different flavors and sauces. Waiters and waitresses are very friendly and care about the food and people.
