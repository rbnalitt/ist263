        <h3>Welcome to Food 4 foodies! I’m SO happy you’re here!</h3>
        <p>My name is Ricki and I created Food 4 foodies to share my love for food with everyone. You should know that I’m totally obsessed with food. Not only do I love eating food but researching restaurants, cooking, and taking pictures of everything I put into my body. I am a total foodie (or at least I like to refer to myself as one ;)). Growing up my parents took me to all the hot new YUMMY restaurants. I learned from the best. Taking after them I am always on the hunt for somewhere different but amazing. I am that person that has a list of restaurants always in their notes, and book-marked images and restaurants in their Instagram. I am the recommender always. I have always wanted a designated place to look for recommendations of restaurants and specifically what to get there but not for every age range but meant for millennials. Yes, there are restaurant reviewers but I always wanted someplace new and different to look. That is why I started this food blog. For all college students and millennials to have a designated place that they can always come for recommendations and new hot places and things. </p>
