                My name is Ricki Nalitt. My <strong>major</strong> is information technology and management. I am interested in social media and web design. Some <strong>skills</strong> I have is organization, being hard working, determined, creative, and innovative. Some of my <strong>hobbies</strong> are going on walks, playing tennis, hanging out with my friends and family, and watching tv. My favorite tv shows are Friends and Entourage. I am also very family oriented. My family is me, my parents, and my twin brother and sister. My brother is just starting at Syracuse also so we are both here now! Overall I am a very hardworking and social person that has both serious and fun sides.
